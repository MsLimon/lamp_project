## Description: 

Interactive LED-lamp with gesture sensor using Arduino.

A led strand (paste link) and plastic cups were used to assemble the lamp. (see video : [Light ball using arduino and Adafruit RGB LEDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDI3CZhqWN4 "Video") )

The LEDs were ordered in two lamps according to the following scheme:

The end result looks like this:
